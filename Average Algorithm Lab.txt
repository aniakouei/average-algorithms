Pseudocode for the Average Algorithm:
1. Set sum to 0
2. Set count to 0
3. For each number 'num' in the array:
   a. If num is positive:
      i. Add num to the sum
      ii. Increment count by 1
4. If count is greater than 0:
   a. Calculate average as sum divided by count
   b. Display the average
5. Else:
   a. Display a message: "No positive numbers found"
6. End
